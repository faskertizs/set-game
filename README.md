# set-game
This project is one of my learning projects which is based on a programming assignment for the iOS course (CS193p) of Stanford University. It still has a work-in-progress status.

Some of the learning topics:
- Swift
- MVVM
- protocol oriented programming
- SwiftUI
- basic binding

The aim of the application is a card game, called SET. See the rules at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)
